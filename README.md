# ***Intro to Virtual Reality Development in Unity***

## ***Basic VR Interaction Experience***
## ***The Foundations of Immersive Interaction***
# ***Background Context***
Dive into the immersive world of Virtual Reality (VR) development with Unity! In the “Basic VR Interaction Experience” project, you’ll embark on an exciting journey to create a foundational VR environment. This project offers a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing various VR locomotion systems, interactive UI elements, and environmental design within Unity.

Through this project, students will learn to set up a standard VR project, explore different methods of VR locomotion, and design interactive elements that respond to user actions. By crafting a simple yet interactive VR environment, students will lay the groundwork for more complex VR applications. Let’s step into the virtual realm and bring these interactive experiences to life!

Configure a Unity project for VR and import necessary assets. Implement various locomotion systems and understand their use cases in VR. Develop basic object and UI interactions specific to VR environments. Integrate various systems to create a functional VR experience. Document the project’s development process and explain its functionality.

# ***Technical Description***
*This project will cover several essential areas in VR development:*

## ***1 - VR Project Setup***

- Guide students through creating a new Unity project tailored for VR development.
- Install and configure necessary packages like XR Plugin Management for various VR platforms (e.g., Oculus, HTC Vive).
- Teach the setup of the main camera and VR controllers for interaction.

## ***2 - VR Locomotion Systems***

- Teleportation: Implement a teleportation system with raycasting to identify valid targets.
- Smooth Locomotion: Develop joystick/thumbstick-based movement for more fluid navigation.
- Advanced Locomotion: Explore additional systems like climbing or jumping, time permitting.

## ***3 - Interactive Environment Design***

- Discuss the use of physics layers and terrain objects for creating interactive floors.
- Test and adjust colliders for optimal interaction with the VR locomotion systems.

## ***4 - Interactive UI Elements***

- Design canvas-based and physical button interactions in the VR space.
- Implement gaze-based or pointer-based UI interactions.
- Create context-sensitive UI elements that respond to the user’s location and actions.

## ***5 - Building a Test Environment***

- Assist students in designing a simple VR environment with Unity’s primitives or models.
- Ensure the environment supports the testing of different locomotion and interaction systems.

## ***6 - Integration and Testing***

- Merge locomotion systems and interactive elements to form a cohesive VR experience.
- Conduct tests and encourage iteration based on user feedback.

*Use Unity ***2021.3.x*** to build your project, ensuring compatibility and leveraging the latest features.*

# ***Learning Objectives***

At the end of this project, you should be able to confidently <u>explain explain to anyone</u>, without the help of Google:

- The setup and configuration process for a VR project in Unity.
- Different VR locomotion techniques and their implementation in Unity.
- The design and integration of interactive UI elements in a VR environment.
- Develop basic object and UI interactions specific to VR environments.
- Integrate various systems to create a functional VR experience.

# ***Requirements***
## ***General***
- Include a README.md file at the root of the project directory
- Employ Unity’s default .gitignore in your intro-to-vr directory
- Push the entire project folder intro-to-vr to your repo
- Ensure all project assets (such as Scenes, Scripts, Materials, etc.) are organized as per the tasks outlined.
- Include ample comments and markup in your scripts to clarify functionality, flag bugs, and enhance readability.
- Free or paid external assets may be used in this project, provided that they are properly credited and you have received approval from your instructor.

# ***Tasks***
***0. VR Camera and Controller Configuration***

Create a new project and configure it for VR by importing OpenXR and the XR Interaction Toolkit.

Then, set up your VR camera and controllers using the sample assets.

Test the camera and controller set up in a VR environment to ensure accurate tracking and interaction.
